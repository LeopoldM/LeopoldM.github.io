abstract: We develop a model where consumers self-select into different electricity contracts based on heterogeneity in their willingness to pay, which varies over time. We characterize the demand for two contracts (i) a fixed-price contract and (ii) a real-time pricing contract. We then derive the contract price equilibrium under two market structures that determine which firms set the fixed price, one with competitive retailers and another with a regulated monopoly. Under retail competition, selection effects make the fixed-price contract unprofitable, leading to the first-best outcome. In contrast, a regulated monopoly must account for consumers' outside options, which can result in lower social welfare compared to a setting where real-time pricing is unavailable. Finally, we extend the model to explore cross-subsidies when consumer types are private information and discuss potential extensions to renewable integration and more complex consumer behaviors.
