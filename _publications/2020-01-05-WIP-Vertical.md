title: "Optimal Capacity Regulation and Vertical Integration"
collection: workinprogress
categories : wip
abstract: Several markets are characterized by incumbents who are forced by the regulatory authorities to make part of their productive investments available to their competitors. In this paper, we study the equilibrium and welfare effect of such regulation where the incumbent who produces in a wholesale market and sells in a retail market is forced to offer parts of its productive capacity to an independent retailer. We assume that an incumbent producer competes with an independent producer via a multi-unit auction wholesale market. Both firms offer a step function and are capacity-constrained. The incumbent firm owns a retailer that competes Ã  la Cournot with an independent retailer. We first describe the effect of vertical integration in that context. Then, we show how allocating part of the production capacity to the independent retailer changes the equilibrium in both markets. Then, we analyze the optimal capacity offered that maximizes welfare.
