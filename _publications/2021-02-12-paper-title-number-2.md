This paper studies the provision of essential goods with time-varying and uncertain stochastic demand. They are typically under-procured by private agents, which leads to under-investment to meet peak demand compared to the socially optimal. To restore efficiency, a regulator can implement a reservation market where he determines the capacity required to meet peak demand and organizes the procurement of the necessary capacity before the demand is known. The paper contributes to the literature by developing a novel approach to studying the demand function's design in the reservation market and the interdependencies with the subsequent production and retail markets for the essential good. We provide a complete framework using a sequential analytical model of the three markets and demonstrate how the reservation market design affects the demand and the equilibria in the production and retail markets. We describe different market design regimes, the process through which those markets are impacted, and their outcome in terms of investment level, prices, and welfare. The model results are discussed first using a general framework and then with a closed-form solution in reference to the example of electricity markets where capacity reservation is often used to ensure adequate investment to ensure the security of supplies.
