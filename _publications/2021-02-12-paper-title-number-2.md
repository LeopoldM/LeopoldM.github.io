In many countries, capacity markets have been put in place to supplement wholesale markets revenues to ensure an adequate generation capacity to maintain the security of supply. This paper study the bidding behavior in those markets and how it can be affected by different capacity product designs. A capacity market allows producers to lock in capacity revenues in advance in exchange for their commitment to be available and to produce over a certain period. Therefore, producers' capacity bid depends on the opportunity cost of making the investment available on the market. We propose a novel approach to conceptualize capacity bids beyond the canonical net present value framework using real option theory. First, we define a bid in a simplified capacity market as a European Put Option. Then, we expand to a more realistic setting by assuming that capacity bids can be evaluated similarly as a modified Basket Option. Moreover, there has been little research on the interplay between the product/commitment duration and the marginal opportunity cost for providing capacity availability. Using the real-option approach, we provide a first attempt to untangle the different drivers of the marginal cost for providing capacity availability. We analyze the determinants of the option value concomitantly with the length of the procurement and deduce some policy implications for the product's design. Finally, we provide a numerical illustration of this issue using data from the French power system.
