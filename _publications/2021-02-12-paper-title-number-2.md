We study the effects of different capacity product designs on investment and production decisions in electricity markets. Using a single project valuation model, we simulate future profits of different generation technologies. We give the investment the options to participate in the capacity market and two managerial options: postponing investment decisions and mothballing the asset. We show that the bidding behavior in the capacity market and production decisions are significantly correlated with the procurement design. Hence, this mechanism's role in correcting electricity market inefficiencies and the incentive to invest in greener technologies could be altered considerably by policymakers' choice in product designs. This study fits into a general framework as soon as a regulator has implemented a secondary market in which agents sell a commitment in a primary market. The model created for this paper can also be adapted to take into account risks and information issues.
