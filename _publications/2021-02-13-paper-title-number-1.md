This paper studies reserve markets' design, aiming to provide producers with sufficient incentives to invest in production capacities. For some essential goods such as electricity or medical supplies, wholesale markets' private incentives are sometimes not adequate to ensure that producers make enough investments. While the supply function emerges naturally from producers on those markets, the demand function is not always spontaneous. The public-good nature of investment during high demand periods implies that consumers do not willingly participate in those reserve markets. Then, the regulator must administratively create the demand function so the market can clear.  Therefore, its design can take various forms depending on which agents sustain the cost of capacity. To assess each design implication, we introduce an analytical model to represent the interdependencies between three electricity markets:  the upstream energy market, the downstream retail market, and the capacity market.  We start by including imperfect competition in the downstream retail market into the classical investment decisions' model with uncertain demand. Then we describe how each design option modifies the equilibrium in the downstream market. Therefore, each demand specification also impacts the demand function made by retailers in the upstream market. In turn, it can lower or increase investment in generation capacity. As our model characterized an equilibrium, the supply function, and the demand function on the three markets, it is easily expandable to agent heterogeneity and information issues.
