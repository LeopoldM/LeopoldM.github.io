abstract:  This paper examines the challenges of allocating a good subject to capacity constraints such as electricity when considering consumer preferences and investment decisions. A theoretical framework is developed where a market designer sequentially chooses a level of investment and proposes an allocation mechanism to consumers followed by a consumption stage. The market designer uses the allocation to maximize consumer surplus and finance the investment cost. He faces heterogeneous consumers who have private information about their demand level and belong to a publicly observed category, allowing the market designer to distinguish groups of consumers such as households or industries. We show that the optimal allocation implies discriminating against consumers based on their types and categories and that the relative discrimination depends on the level of investment considered. It has significant welfare and distributive implications: an optimal pricing mechanism can minimize the investment cost and lead to a higher aggregate consumer surplus. However, it is not always a Pareto improvement for every consumer, especially for smaller ones. We describe two main environments: the current second-best situation, in which the market designer cannot obtain information about consumers and must choose fixed prices ex-ante, and the optimal theoretical second-best allocation mechanism that considers the incentive and individual rationality constraints and the investment decisions.
