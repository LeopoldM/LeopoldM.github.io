excerpt: "We study equilibrium contract adoption in retail electricity markets
  in which consumers differ in their willingness to pay over time and can choose
  between a fixed-price contract (FP) and real-time pricing contract (RTP).
  Self-selection alters the consumption profile and, in turn, the cost of
  serving FP customers, creating an adverse-selection channel with endogenous
  costs. In a competitive retail segment, this channel unravels the FP contract:
  any private retailer that attracts FP customers is left with a pool that is
  too costly to serve at break-even. Under a regulated monopoly offering the FP
  contract, contract choice instead disciplines pricing: the monopoly
  internalizes consumer sorting to the RTP contract and may cut its price to
  retain low-cost customers. This pricing response can increase inefficient peak
  consumption and reduce welfare relative to a benchmark without an RTP
  contract. We characterize the monopoly’s pricing rule, show how consumer
  heterogeneity governs the strength of the sorting incentive, and discuss
  regulatory instruments (two-part tariffs and loss-financing rules) that
  mitigate the welfare cost of opt-in RTP contracts."
abstract: This paper examines the challenges of allocating a good subject to
  capacity constraints such as electricity when considering consumer preferences
  and investment decisions. A theoretical framework is developed where a market
  designer sequentially chooses a level of investment and proposes an allocation
  mechanism to consumers followed by a consumption stage. The market designer
  uses the allocation to maximize consumer surplus and finance the investment
  cost. He faces heterogeneous consumers who have private information about
  their demand level and belong to a publicly observed category, allowing the
  market designer to distinguish groups of consumers such as households or
  industries. We show that the optimal allocation implies discriminating against
  consumers based on their types and categories and that the relative
  discrimination depends on the level of investment considered. It has
  significant welfare and distributive implications - an optimal pricing
  mechanism can minimize the investment cost and lead to a higher aggregate
  consumer surplus. However, it is not always a Pareto improvement for every
  consumer, especially for smaller ones. We describe two main environments - the
  current second-best situation, in which the market designer cannot obtain
  information about consumers and must choose fixed prices ex-ante, and the
  optimal theoretical second-best allocation mechanism that considers the
  incentive and individual rationality constraints and the investment decisions.
