title: "Vertical integration and retail competition with an incumbent"

abstract: This paper presented a model combining a vertically integrated market structure with potential new entrants and a situation where less efficient competitors can source their inputs at a lower cost resulting from a legal constrain imposed by the regulator. This analysis highlights the French power market's current market structure and legal context. The first model shows that new entries exist when competitors are more efficient in the retail market. The second model only describes three cases with three different equilibriums on the retail market; the supply costs are assumed exogenous. The central point of the combined model is the endogenization of the supply costs of competitors, which become a strategic variable for the incumbent. In other terms, I introduce the three equilibriums inside the vertically integrated model. Therefore, I demonstrated that the ARENH allows new entrants that are less efficient than the incumbent, which was not possible under the vertical integration. I showed that the level of ARENH is not impacting new entries but can significantly modify firms' profit. Higher levels mean a lower share of the retail market for the incumbent, or to say it differently, a lower market power.
