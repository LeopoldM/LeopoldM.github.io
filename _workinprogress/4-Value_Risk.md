abstract:  One of the fundamental dimensions of the investment decision is risk. This is particularly true for electricity producers because they are significant investments with long lifetimes and face significant uncertainties. To study this problem, we will establish in the first part a theoretical basis of risk analysis. We will present the approaches allowing players to value a risky investment in different ways. In particular, we will underline that each approach involves the analysis of a particular risk, but also specific assumptions about the relationship that an economic actor has with the risk. In a second part, we will propose a model describing a simplified version of a power plant. This representation will allow us to model in a complex way the estimates of income that an actor can receive in the electricity markets. The objective of this second part is to represent a risk profile specific to the revenues of a power plant. To do this, we will use empirical data from the French electricity market as well as several scenarios allowing us to have different assumptions about the players. This first model will be followed by an application of the valuation approaches proposed in the first step. This third part will thus give a risk-adjusted value of the income received in the electricity markets. We will conclude by analyzing the results of this valuation, which will shed light both on the theoretical questions raised by the use of the different methods, but also on the risks that may be observed on the electricity market in France during the period studied.
