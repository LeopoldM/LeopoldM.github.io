title: "Simulating the impact of product design and risk on a power plant value with a capacity market"
collection: workinprogress
abstract: We study the effects of different product designs on an investment value in the context of capacity markets. We simulate the future profits of a hypothetical nuclear using a single project  valuation model. It allows representing the imperfection of the energy market and the bids associated with the participation in a capacity market. We find that the procurement characteristics, namely the period when investors receive the remuneration, and the length of the obligation period, significantly modify the investment value if we assume they receive what they offer. The introduction of risk aversion doesnâ€™t fundamentally change the results of the risk-neutral case even though it can significantly lower the investment value. Furthermore, we find that the approach used to model risk matters when comparing the effect of different capacity products. Further extensions of the model would highlight other indirect effects of capacity markets while giving interesting empirical results.
