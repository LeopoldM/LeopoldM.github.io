**Welcome !**

------

I am currently an economics Ph.D. student at the University of Paris Dauphine - PSL in Paris, planning to graduate in 2023. 


My research interests include Microeconomic Theory applied to the electricity sector, with a deep interest lying both in Market Design and Industrial Organisation, with a broad view on Mechanism Design, Decision Theory, Political Economy, and Regulatory economics.

------

I mainly work on 

- Investment Decisions and their relationship with subsequent markets. 
- The design of Capacity Markets where producers can sell their investment availability in advance in return for additional remuneration. 

Even though I work primarily in the electricity sector, I am deeply interested in using theoretical advances from other economic fields to help build a more resilient energy system. At the same time, I am convinced that feedback from past and current experiences in electricity markets could significantly improve our understanding of how to efficiently provide essential goods such as medical supplies.
