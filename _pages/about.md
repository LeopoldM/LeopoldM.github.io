Welcome !

------

I am currently an economics PhD student at the University of Paris Dauphine - PSL in Paris, planning to graduate in 2022. 


My research interests include Applied Microeconomic Theory to the electricity sector. With a broader interest in Market Design, Mechanism Design , Industrial Organisation, Decision Theory and Regulatory economics.

------

I mainly work on the design of capacity markets, so that we are sure to have enough investment to produce electricity when needed at the lowest cost. You can find my works here [here](http://leopoldmonjoie.com/publications/)
