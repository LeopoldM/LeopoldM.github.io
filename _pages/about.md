**Welcome!**

------

I will be a postdoctoral fellow at Aalto University in September 2024. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Paris Dauphine - PSL in March 2024.  

My research interests include Microeconomic Theory applied to the Electricity Markets, with a deep interest lying at the crossroads between Market Design and Industrial Organisation, with a broad view on Mechanism Design, Decision Theory, Political Economy, and Regulatory economics.

------

I mainly work on the following:

- Investment decisions and their relationship with markets. 
- The design of long-term mechanisms to provide resilient economic systems. 

Even though I work primarily in the electricity sector, I am interested in using theoretical advances from other economic fields to help build a more resilient energy system. At the same time, feedback from past and current experiences in electricity markets could significantly improve our understanding of how to efficiently provide essential goods.
