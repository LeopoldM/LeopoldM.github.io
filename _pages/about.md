**Welcome!**

------

Currently doing an economics Ph.D. at the University of Paris Dauphine - PSL in Paris and planning to graduate in March 2024.  **I am on the international economics academic job market in 2023-2024**.


My research interests include Microeconomic Theory applied to the electricity sector, with a deep interest lying at the crossroads between Market Design and Industrial Organisation, with a broad view on Mechanism Design, Decision Theory, Political Economy, and Regulatory economics.

------

I mainly work on the following:

- Investment decisions and their relationship with markets. 
- The design of long-term markets to provide sufficient investments. 

Even though I work primarily in the electricity sector, I am deeply interested in using theoretical advances from other economic fields to help build a more resilient energy system. At the same time, feedback from past and current experiences in electricity markets could significantly improve our understanding of how to efficiently provide essential goods.
