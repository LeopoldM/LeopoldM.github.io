**Welcome!**

------

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher in Environmental Economics at Aalto University. I study how market design and regulation can deliver reliable, efficient, and equitable outcomes in energy and environmental markets. My current work focuses on:

- Consumer choice and redistributive policy,
- Investment decisions,
- Long-run mechanisms to ensure reliable electricity supply.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Paris Dauphine-PSL in 2024.
