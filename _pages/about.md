**Welcome!**

------

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Environmental Economics at Aalto University. My research interests lie at the crossroads between Market Design, Regulation, and Industrial Organisation.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Paris Dauphineâ€”PSL in 2024.  

See the latest version of my CV [here](https://LeopoldM.github.io/files/cvacademic.pdf).

------

I mainly work on the following:

- Consumer choices and redistributive policies.
- Investment decisions. 
- The design of long-term mechanisms to provide resilient economic systems. 

Even though I work primarily in the electricity sector, I am interested in using theoretical advances from other economic fields to help build a more resilient energy system. At the same time, feedback from past and current experiences in electricity markets could significantly improve our understanding of how to efficiently provide essential goods.
