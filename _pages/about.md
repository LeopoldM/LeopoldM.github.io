**Welcome !**

------

I am currently an economics PhD student at the University of Paris Dauphine - PSL in Paris, planning to graduate in 2023. 


My research interests include Microeconomic Theory applied to the electricity sector, with a deep interest lying both in Market Design and Industrial Organisation, with also a broad view on Mechanism Design, Decision Theory, Political Economy and Regulatory economics.

------

I mainly work on 

- Investment Decisions and their relation with subsequent markets. 
- The design of Capacity Markets where producers can sell their investment avability in advance. 

You can find my works here [here](http://leopoldmonjoie.com/publications/)
