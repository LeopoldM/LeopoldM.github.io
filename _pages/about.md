Welcome !

------

I am currently an economics PhD student at the University of Paris Dauphine - PSL in Paris, planning to graduate in 2022. 


My research interests include Microeconomic Theory applied to the electricity sector, with a broader interest in Market Design, Mechanism Design , Industrial Organisation, Decision Theory and Regulatory economics.

------

I mainly work on the design of capacity markets, so that we have enough investment to produce electricity when needed and at the lowest cost. You can find my works here [here](http://leopoldmonjoie.com/publications/)
